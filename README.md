This is the initial project for app development practice. 

# 1. Description

Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has been spreading uncontrolledly across the world. Due to the virus high infectivity and long gap-period of displaying symptoms, it's hard to predict what is our infection status (whether we are infected (F0), or closed to the infected people (F1),...). This is a project to help determining your infection status based on the information you provide about your physical contacts with other people recently.

# 2. How it works

The app will gather your necessary personal information: your name, phone number, regional and country address, people's information that you have physical contacts recently, and your infection status if you are sure about it.

Based on the information, the app will calculate your infection status based on the minimum number of your inputed infection status (that you are sure about it), and the minimum status of your contacts plus 1. You can update your status anytime so that people will know if they are closer to being infected.
